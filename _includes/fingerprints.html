			<b>Software Engineering Intern - IIT Bombay (May 2015 - July 2015)</b> <br>
I worked on a web app named 'RuralICT' which was based on Spring web framework in the backend part and AngularJS, Bootstrap on the front end part. I coded backend and frontend for many functionalities in the app. Git was used for team collaboration. The project was guided by Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan (Dept. of CSE, IIT Bombay) under the Eklavya summer internship programme.
