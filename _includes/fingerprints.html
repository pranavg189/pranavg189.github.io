			<b>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Intern - GNOME Foundation (May 2016 - August 2016)</b> <br>
Interned under Google Summer of Code program with GNOME Foundation. The project was about improving the search functionality in GNOME Logs. GNOME Logs is a software to view and organize the logs generated by the journald daemon in a Linux based OS using systemd as init system. During the summer, I worked on transferring the search functionality from view to model, adding a search popover and writing a search provider which can be used to query results from the GNOME Shell overview. Entire project abstract can be viewed <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5228615276953600">here</a>. The bugs that I worked on are listed in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X444jRRdH0AgixSrUFQdwzfeUTiZ9BLQ4XKZsNbaalI/edit?usp=sharing">document</a>.
